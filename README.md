# Forecast drinking trends

The aim of the code in this repo is to support the analyst team in understanding how to use the model to forecast trends in alcohol consumption - by providing a complete workflow. It is just a draft working example and should be treated as such.   

The forecasting here is based on alc.tools v0.1.0 and the Health Survey for England.   

It projects the proportion of drinkers and distribution of alcohol consumed by drinkers to 2025. The forecast of the proportion of drinkers is based on HSE 2001-2017 and the forecast of the distribution of consumption is based on the HSE 2011-2017, since 2011 was the start of usable data recording.
