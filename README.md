# Forecast drinking trends

The aim of the code in this repo is to support our analyst team in understanding how to use the R packages underlying our modelling to forecast trends in alcohol consumption - by providing a complete workflow. This is just a working draft example and should be treated as such.   

The forecasting here is based on alc.tools v0.1.0 and the Health Survey for England. 

At the moment only members of our project team are able to run this code because it depends on a number of R packages that we have developed and that are currently stored in private repos.   

The workflow here projects the proportion of drinkers and distribution of alcohol consumed by drinkers to 2025. The forecast of the proportion of drinkers is based on HSE 2001-2017 and the forecast of the distribution of consumption is based on the HSE 2011-2017, since 2011 was the start of usable data recording.
